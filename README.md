# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio website of me. It was done to demonstrate the use of using react and express with node to make a functional
website that can show off my skills. I built this to show off my recent projects and skills and to gain leads.
The portfolio website solves the problem of using bootstrap with react to get routes and displaying the appropriate content.
I learned how to use bootstrap and react together in a full web application.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
