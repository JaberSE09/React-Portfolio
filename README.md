# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio website of me. It was done to demonstrate the use of using react and express with node to make a functional
website that can show off my skills. I built this to show off my recent projects and skills and to gain leads.
The portfolio website solves the problem of using bootstrap with react to get routes and displaying the appropriate content.
I learned how to use bootstrap and react together in a full web application.
